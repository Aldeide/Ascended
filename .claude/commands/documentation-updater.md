Documentation Updater

Maintain project documentation (README, operational guides, reference docs) as a first-class part of shipping changes. Keep documentation accurate and executable as code evolves.

When to use
Activate this Skill when:

A change alters how to run/test locally (development environment setup, containerization, bootstrapping).
You add/remove/change environment variables, secrets, or configuration files.
You change environment/deployment assumptions used by scripts or tools.
You add/modify operational scripts (deployment, data seeding, logging, maintenance tasks).
You update integrations with external services or APIs.
You modify infrastructure setup or deployment processes.
Principles
Prefer updating existing docs over adding new ones. Add a new doc only when it clearly reduces confusion.
Keep docs executable. Commands must match actual scripts/tools; paths must match the project structure.
Respect environment requirements. When docs tell users to run commands/tests, include the correct environment setup steps (e.g., sourcing environment files, activating virtual environments, loading configuration).
Document "what & why", not internal trivia. Focus on user outcomes and maintenance workflows.
Cross-link instead of duplicating. Use references to maintain a single source of truth.
Workflow
1) Determine doc impact from the change
Identify what category the change falls into and what docs it likely affects.

2) Update the smallest set of docs that restores accuracy
Update only the relevant sections; avoid broad rewrites.
Keep headings and tone consistent with the existing file.
Prefer adding links from main documentation to detailed reference docs for deep dives, instead of duplicating instructions.
3) Add "quick verification" steps
When documenting new or changed workflows, include:

The exact command(s) to run (use project-standard task runners or scripts).
The expected output/behavior at a high level (1–2 bullets).
Any common failure mode and how to fix it (1 short subsection max).
4) Check for drift and broken references
Confirm referenced scripts/commands exist in the project.
Confirm file paths and directory references exist in the repository.
Verify external links are still valid and accessible.
